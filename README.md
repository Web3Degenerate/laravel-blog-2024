## Commands

1. Create Laravel Project with Composer: 
    - `composer create-project laravel/laravel <name-of-app>`


2. Spin up local server: 
    - `php artisan serve`

3. Controller
    - `php artisan make:controller ExampleController`

4. Database Migrations
    - Run migration files: 
        - `php artisan migrate`
    - Fresh command ONLY when empty DB tables
        - This drops EVERY table in the DB, starts fresh, so you can edit the original migration file with your changes. 
        - `php artisan migrate:fresh`
    - Modify table **WHEN YOU HAVE DATA** - create new migration file
        - `php artisan make:migration add_favorite_column_to_users`
        - After set up new migration file execute with _php artisan migrate_
    - Later, add isAdmin column to Users table: 
        - `php artisan make:migration add_isadmin_column_to_users_table --table=users`
            - the `--table=users` flag adds some boiler plate in the migration file for us.

5. Set up NEW migration file for a new table: 
    - `php artisan make:migration create_posts_table`
        - _execute migration file with_ `php artisan migrate`

6. Set up NEW model with: 
     - `php artisan make:model Post`
        - _He used singular for both Controller and Model_

7. Set up your own custom **Middleware** with this command: 
    - `php artisan make:middleware MustBeLoggedIn`
        - Add your code. 
        - Add to `/Http/Kernel.php`, towards the botttom, as described around [(12:15)](https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34400816#overview)
        - 

8. Create a Laravel Policy with command: 
    - `php artisan make:policy PostPolicy --model=Post`

## Components instead of include()
- Starts [(11:50)](https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34130780#content)

1. Create folder **components** in `/views` directory. Name matters. 
2. Create `views/components/layout.blade.php` (_file name not matter_).
3. Add Header code
4. Add `{{$slot}}` to display dynamic content
5. Add Footer Code
6. Add to `homepage.blade.php` with this syntax: 

```php
//Instead of include
@include('header')

//Use x
<x-layout>
    //Place view content here to display in our $slot
</x-layout>

```

### Laravel Sessions
- Click 'inspect' => dev tools => 'Application' => 'Cookies' => site
    - see `laravel_session`
- Display logged in user's name with `{{auth()->user()->username}}`. See [(19:11)](https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34207654#overview)

- 


### Useful Tips

- Save user input between attempts: 
    - use `value="{{old('field-name')}}`. See [(16:15)](https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34207648#overview)
    - 

- To look up user by field **other than id** simply specify in the routes like this: 

```php
// web.php
Route::get('/profile/{pizza:username}', [UserController::class, 'profile']);

// UserController.php - profile function:
    // GET INSTANCE OF USER with TYPE HINTING = User <{name-used-in-routes}>
    public function profile(User $pizza){
        //instance of the User model with type hinting

        return view('profile-posts');
    }

```



---

## **Middleware**
    - Protect pages - Unauthorized Redirect: 
    - Instead of using `!auth()->check()` like below

```php
    public function showCreateForm(){
        //(~1:30) - Add redirect if /create-post accessed by guest:
        if (!auth()->check()) {
            return redirect('/');
        } 
        return view('create-post');
    }

```

- In the `web.php` routes file add middleware with: 

```php

//Add ->middleware('auth') 
Route:: get('/create-post', [PostController::class, 'showCreateForm'])->middleware('auth');

//This requires us to 'name' one of our other routes as 'login' for laravel to send the redirect
```


---
### Policy
- See [(~4:00)](https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34426438#overview)

- Create a policy from terminal with command: 
    - `php artisan make:policy PostPolicy --model=Post`

- Laravel's Policy allows us to avoid having to do things like check if the currently logged in user is the user of the a given post: 

```php

//PostController.php
    public function viewSinglePost(Post $post){
        if($post->user_id === auth()->user()->id){
            return 'you are the author';
        }
        return 'you are not the author;
    }

```

- Update the Policies you want to control, _in this example, edit and delete_ in the new folder `Http/Policies/PostPolicy.php`

```php

    public function update(User $user, Post $post): bool
    {
        // (~7:00): https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34426438#overview
        return $user->id === $post->user_id;
    }

    /**
     * Determine whether the user can delete the model.
     */
    public function delete(User $user, Post $post): bool
    {
        // (~7:00): https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34426438#overview
        return $user->id === $post->user_id;
    }
```

- Finally, register our new **PostPolicy.php** in `App/Providers/AuthServiceProviders.php` in the `protected $policies` array, let Laravel know what class our new custom policy should be applied to: 

```php
// Added (7:55): https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34426438#overview
    
    protected $policies = [
        Post::class => PostPolicy::class
    ];

```


```php

// Added (7:55): https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34426438#overview
    protected $policies = [
        Post::class => PostPolicy::class
    ];
```

## Install MySQL on Windows
[View tutorial here](https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34182370#content)

1. Visit [mysql.com](https://www.mysql.com/) and follow google doc instructions. 

---
 
## Connect Local Laravel to Local MySQL - **migrations**
- **Source:** [See tutorial here.](https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34197742#content)

1. Connect to DB in `.env` file

```js
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=ourlaravelapp
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=rootroot

```

2. in the **migrations** directory we have the default migrations from Laravel. 

3. Run the migrate command from terminal in project directory to create the default tables laravel has created for us: 
    - `php artisan migrate`

---


## Set up Notes (Posts) Database 
- Started [(9:30)](https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34351476#overview)

- Set up migration file for posts db with command: 
    - `php artisan make:migration create_posts_table`

    - See around [(13:00)](https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34351476#overview) to see how the migration file was set up between `users` and `posts`

    - Run the migration file with: 
        - `php artisan migrate`

```php
    public function up(): void
    {
        Schema::create('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->timestamps();
            $table->string('title');
            $table->longText('body');
            $table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained();
        });
    }

```

- Set up model for Posts with this command: 
    - He used **singular Post**
    - `php artisan make:model Post`


### Set up foreign key relationship in **Post.php** model to User
- See [(1:20)](https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34351482#overview)

- Add the relationship b/t Post and User (`belongsTo`) in **Post.php**

```php
//Post.php
    //(1:40) - Set relationship to User: https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34351482#overview
    // public function user(){
    public function pizza(){
        //this is Post object as a whole
        // look inside '$this' and call method 'belongs to'
                        //(1) Class belongs to, (2) Column powered by. Column powers the lookup or join. 
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'user_id');
    }

```
### Set up User-Post relationship in **User.php** model: 
- This was covered around [(8:55)](https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34400818#overview)

- Here is the **User.php** function we added: 

```php
//User.php
// Added (~9:38) - https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34400818#overview
    public function posts() {
        //A user Has MANY posts:
        // hasMany(target class, column powering this relationship)
        return $this->hasMany(Post::class, 'user_id');
    }

//Then use new relationship in UserController.php: 


```
-- **This will now return the following:**

```json
[
    {"id":1,"created_at":"2024-01-16T22:28:53.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-01-16T22:28:53.000000Z","title":"My First Post","body":"The sky is blue.","user_id":1},

    {"id":2,"created_at":"2024-01-16T22:36:22.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-01-16T22:36:22.000000Z","title":"My Second Blog Post","body":"Did you know that 2 + 2 is 4?","user_id":1},
    
    {"id":3,"created_at":"2024-01-16T23:52:37.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-01-16T23:52:37.000000Z","title":"My Third Post","body":"This is a test.","user_id":1},
    
    {"id":4,"created_at":"2024-01-17T00:03:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-01-17T00:03:42.000000Z","title":"Quick Test Post","body":"# My heading\r\n\r\nMake something **bold** or *italics*.","user_id":1}
    ]
```


#### Run Migration To Add Table to Users Table
- See [(3:15)](https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34426448#overview)

- To set up the [migration file to add a column to existing table at (3:30)](https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34426448#overview), run command: 
    `php artisan make:migration add_isadmin_column_to_users_table --table=users`

### Set up a 'Gate' in Laravel 

- See [tutorial here.](https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34426458#overview)

- Set up route in `web.php`

- In `app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php` edit the **boot()** function: 

```php

// (5:20) Must uncomment reference to Gate provided by laravel: https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34426458#overview
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Gate;
// (3:30) - set up 'Gate': https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-learn-laravel-a-guided-path-for-beginners/learn/lecture/34426458#overview
    // public function boot(): void //OUR version had void
    public function boot() 
    {
        //our version missing '$this->registerPolicies();
        $this->registerPolicies();

        //spell out our gate: 
        // Gate::define('label', function)
        Gate::define('visitAdminPages', function($user){
            return $user->isAdmin === 1;
        });
    }

//Then in web.php (or controller) use our gate as follows: 
Route::get('/admins-only', function(){
    //Set normal controller and functions here.
    if (Gate::allows('visitAdminPages')) {
        //restricted content here.
        return 'Only admins should be able to see this page';
    }
    return 'You can not view this page.';
});

```


### Push Local Laravel to Github
1. **Create Github Repo** - However, do not initialize it with a README or .gitignore at this point.
2. **Initialize Repo** - In Laravel project directory check if there is a Git repository with 
    - `git status`
    - If this fails, not a git repository then initialize one with the ole' 
        - `git init`

3. **Set Remote URL**
4. **Add changes and commit**
5. **Push up to the remote**


### Copy Project to another directory

1. Copy files Locally
    - `cp -r path/to/myApp path/to/newProject`

### Copy Project to another directory on another computer
1. Clone the repository
    - `git clone https://github.com/your_username/myApp.git`

2. Copy Files to new directory 'newProject'
    - `cp -r myApp path/to/newProject`

3. Navigate to 'newProject' Directory
    - `cd path/to/newProject`

4. **CHANGE REMOTE URL** - point the 'newProject' to the new clean repo: 
    `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your_username/newProjectRepo.git`

5. Make changes and Push: 
    ```js
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    git push -u origin master
    ```
6. _There should not be any conflict between the two projects as long as you are working in separate directories ('myApp' and 'newProject'). Each project will have its own Git repository, and changes made in one project will not affect the other._

7. _When you copy files from 'path/to/myApp' to 'path/to/newProject', you are essentially duplicating the project directory. The initialized Git repository (the .git directory) is part of the project structure, and it will be copied along with the files. As a result, the new directory ('newProject') will still be associated with the same Git repository as the original ('myApp')._
    - **You can confirm this by checking if the 'newProject' directory contains '.git' directory with this command to attempt to ls the '.git' repository:**
    - 
    - `ls path/to/newProject/.git`
        ```js
        $ ls ourmainapp/.git
        COMMIT_EDITMSG  config       hooks/  info/  objects/
        HEAD            description  index   logs/  refs/

        ```
    - If no git repository exists, expect a result like: 
        ```js
        $ ls dent/.git
        ls: cannot access 'dent/.git': No such file or directory

        ```
    - To remove multiple non-empty directories, use: 
        - `rm -r directory1 directory2 directory3`
    - To remove an empty directory use: 
        `rmdir directory_name`
    - **(Optional):** _Confirming Deletion_ vs _Force Removal_
        - _If you want to be prompted for confirmation before each removal, you can use the `-i` (interactive) flag:_
            `rm -ri directory_name`
        - _If you want to force removal without any confirmation, you can use the `-f` (force) flag:_
            - `rm -rf directory_name`
    - **AFTER COPYING FOLDER:** The git repository was still present in the new directory. 
        - So to set the new remote repo, use command: 
            - `git remote set-url origin <repo-link>`
            - Then `git add .`
            - `git commit -m "<commit-message>"`
            - `git push -u origin master`
    - **Command to get the remote origin**:
        - `git remote show origin`
            - returns something like: _https://github.com/username/laravel-blog-2024.git_
            - x

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 2000 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
